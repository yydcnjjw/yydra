# yydra-cli

`yydra-cli` installs the exact-version `yydra` executable for creating and
diagnosing Product Workspaces initialized from a Yydra Distribution and owned
independently by their product teams.

Install an exact release while preserving its packaged lockfile:

```console
cargo install yydra-cli --version 0.1.0 --locked
```

Create once with one normalized product-source license choice:

```console
yydra new ./reader \
  --product-name "Reader" \
  --product-id reader \
  --product-source-license Apache-2.0
```

The choice governs only source newly authored by the Product team. Copied Yydra
bytes remain `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, third-party bytes retain their original terms
and notices, and both complete Yydra license texts ship with the package and the
new Workspace. `.yydra/distribution-inventory.json` records lifecycle,
provenance, mode, digest, license-notice authority, and edit authority.

Creation does not establish a template rerun, synchronization, upgrade,
compatibility-range, or Distribution-version override contract.
